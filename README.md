Theme: castaway (+ goats)

This is a game about a man who is stranded on an island full of goats...
You must find a way out....

must have python3 and pygame to run

To play game:
```python3 main.py```


Glitches to watch out for when playing
-might have to press space multiple times when trying to interact with goats (or other things)
-if you walk on the edge of the wall and cross the borders, you will be teleported some where really far away and the player glitches out. If this happens, you  will have to restart the game.
